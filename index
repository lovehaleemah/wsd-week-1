					<blockquote>“Remember this, for it is as true and true gets:
					<strong> Your body is not a lemon!</strong> You are not a machine. 
					The Creator is not a careless mechanic. Human female bodies have the 
					same potential to give birth well as aardvarks, lions, rhinoceri, 
					elephants, moose, and water buffalo. Even if it has <em>not</em> been 
					your habit throughout your life so far, I recommend that you learn to 
					think positively about your body.”</blockquote>
