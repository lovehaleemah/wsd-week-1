					<blockquote>“Remember this, for it is as true and true gets:
					<strong> Your body is not a lemon!</strong> You are not a machine. 
					The Creator is not a careless mechanic. Human female bodies have the 
					same potential to give birth well as aardvarks, lions, rhinoceri, 
					elephants, moose, and water buffalo. Even if it has <em>not</em> been 
					your habit throughout your life so far, I recommend that you learn to 
					think positively about your body.”</blockquote>

				<h3>Who is Ina May?</h3>
				<p>Ina May Gaskin is a pioneer in her field, she has often been called 
				the founder of authentic midwifery. In 1971 her and her husband Stephen 
				founded a commune and called it the farm.  At the farm the women formed 
				the first out of hospital birth center.  From there she became famous for
				her apparent talent for being a midwife and doula.  Women did and still
				do travel a long way just to give birth on the farm, with the hope of 
				Ina's attendance.  Her loving and calm presence has been a life saver for
				hundreds of women who long to opt out of the harsh environment of a 
				hospital birth.  In the homebirth community, her books are standard reads.
				  Ina May is also an accomplished author and speaker.  
				She recently appeared in the famous movie "The Business of Being Born" 
				by Rikki Lake.   And to much of her follower's pleasure, a biographical 
				movie has just been released this year.  "Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin 
				&amp; The Farm Midwives". Which chronicles her life and experiences at the  
				farm. She continues to be an inspiration to midwives, doulas, and all who
				are passionate about natural childbirth, bringing awareness and knowledge 
				to the general community about the benefits of non-medicalized, out-of-
				hospital birth.
